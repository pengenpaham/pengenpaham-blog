### Writing Tips :

1. If you written material about technical, don't forget to use `Code Block` in your code examples for better readable code.
2. Don't forget to add `Author Name` on the top of material page you written.
3. Put valid `References` in the bottom page for material references.
4. For new contributor, don't forget to add new profile data in `docs/index.md` at the bottom.
   Example : 
   ```js
    const members = [
      {
        avatar: 'https://www.github.com/ervinismu.png',
        name: 'ervinismu',
        title: 'Creator',
        links: [
          { icon: 'github', link: 'https://github.com/ervinismu' },
          { icon: 'twitter', link: 'https://twitter.com/ervinismu' }
        ]
      }
    ]
   ```
