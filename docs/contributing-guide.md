### Writing Tips :

1. If you written material about technical, don't forget to use `Code Block` in your code examples for better readable code. For example :
   ```ruby
     def say_hello
       puts "hello from pengenpaham! :)"
     end

     say_hello
   ```
2. Don't forget to add `Author Name` on the top of material page you written.
3. Put valid `References` in the bottom page for material references.
4. For new contributor, don't forget to add new profile data in `docs/index.md` at the bottom.
   For Example :
   ```js
    const members = [
      {
        avatar: 'https://www.github.com/ervinismu.png',
        name: 'ervinismu',
        title: 'Contributor',
        links: [
          { icon: 'github', link: 'https://github.com/ervinismu' },
          { icon: 'mastodon', link: 'https://ruby.social/ervinismu' }
        ]
      }
    ]
   ```
